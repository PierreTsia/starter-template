## Example Implementation Steps

1. **Choose a platform:**
   - [x] Sign up for Render, Railway, or another platform
2. **Prepare your app:**

   - [x] Update `package.json` scripts for build/start
3. **Connect repo and configure deploy:**
   - [x] Link your GitHub repo to the platform
   - [x] Set build/start commands (e.g., `pnpm build`, `pnpm start:prod`)
4. **Configure environment variables:**
   - [x] Add secrets in the platform dashboard
5. **Provision database:**
   - [x] Use platform-provided PostgreSQL or connect to an external DB
   - [x] Run migrations automatically on deploy
