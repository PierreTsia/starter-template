# CI and Frontend Deployment Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the steps and requirements for setting up continuous integration and frontend deployment. The goal is to ensure code quality through automated checks and streamline the deployment process.

## CI Setup

- [x] Set up GitHub Actions workflow

  - [x] Create base workflow file
  - [x] Configure Node.js setup
  - [x] Set up pnpm caching
  - [x] Configure workspace setup

- [x] Configure quality checks

  - [x] Run ESLint
  - [x] Run TypeScript type checking
  - [x] Run Vitest tests
  - [x] Configure test coverage reporting

- [x] Set up PR checks
  - [x] Run checks on pull requests
  - [x] Block merges if checks fail
  - [x] Add status badges to README

## Vercel Deployment

- [x] Set up Vercel project

  - [x] Connect GitHub repository
  - [x] Configure build settings
  - [x] Set up environment variables

- [x] Configure deployment settings

  - [x] Set up preview deployments
  - [x] Configure production branch
  - [x] Set up automatic deployments

- [x] Environment configuration
  - [x] Set up production environment variables
  - [x] Configure preview environment variables
  - [x] Set up secrets management

## Definition of Done

The CI and deployment setup is considered complete when:

- [x] All checkboxes above are checked
- [x] GitHub Actions run successfully on PRs
- [x] Vercel deployments work for both preview and production
- [x] Environment variables are properly configured
- [x] Status badges are visible in README
- [x] PR checks block merges when tests fail

## Next Steps

After completing the CI and deployment setup, we will:

1. Set up the backend application (NestJS)
2. Configure the database (Prisma + PostgreSQL)

## Notes

- Keep the CI process fast and efficient
- Ensure proper caching to speed up workflows
- Document any non-obvious configuration
- Consider future scalability
- Maintain security best practices
- Follow GitHub Actions best practices
- Follow Vercel deployment best practices
