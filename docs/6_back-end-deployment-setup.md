  - [ ] Ensure CORS and security settings are production-ready
- [ ] Set up deployment pipeline
  - [ ] Connect repository to deployment platform
  - [ ] Configure automatic deploys on push to main branch
  - [ ] Set up build and start commands in platform dashboard
- [ ] Configure environment variables in the deployment platform
  - [ ] DATABASE_URL
  - [ ] JWT_SECRET
  - [ ] Any other required secrets
- [ ] Set up database (managed or platform-provided)
  - [ ] Provision a PostgreSQL instance

## Example Implementation Steps

1. **Choose a platform:**
   - [ ] Sign up for Render, Railway, or another platform
2. **Prepare your app:**
   - [ ] Add production environment variables to `.env`
   - [ ] Update `package.json` scripts for build/start
3. **Connect repo and configure deploy:**
   - [ ] Link your GitHub repo to the platform
   - [ ] Set build/start commands (e.g., `pnpm build`, `pnpm start:prod`)
4. **Configure environment variables:**
   - [ ] Add secrets in the platform dashboard
5. **Provision database:**
   - [ ] Use platform-provided PostgreSQL or connect to an external DB
   - [ ] Run migrations automatically on deploy
6. **Test and monitor:**
   - [ ] Hit endpoints, check logs, verify auth
7. **(Optional) Set up custom domain and HTTPS**
