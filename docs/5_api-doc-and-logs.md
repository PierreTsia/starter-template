# API Documentation & Logging Implementation Guide

This document outlines the steps and options for implementing API documentation (e.g., Swagger) and structured, informative server logs in your backend application.

---

## Checklist

### API Documentation

- [ ] Choose a documentation tool
  - [ ] Swagger (OpenAPI via NestJS @nestjs/swagger)
  - [ ] Redoc
  - [ ] Other (TBD)
- [ ] Install and configure the chosen tool
- [ ] Annotate controllers, DTOs, and endpoints with documentation decorators/comments
- [ ] Expose the API docs at a dedicated route (e.g., `/api/docs`)
- [ ] Secure the docs route (optional, e.g., only in non-production or behind auth)
- [ ] Keep docs up to date as the API evolves

### Server Logging

- [ ] Choose a logging solution
  - [ ] NestJS built-in Logger
  - [ ] Winston (with @nestjs/winston)
  - [ ] Pino (with @nestjs/pino)
  - [ ] Other (TBD)
- [ ] Implement a dedicated logging service (wraps or extends the chosen logger)
- [ ] Use structured logs (JSON, timestamps, log levels, context)
- [ ] Add informative logs to key events (requests, errors, auth, DB ops, etc.)
- [ ] Configure log output (console, file, external service)
- [ ] Set up log rotation and retention (if writing to files)
- [ ] Ensure logs do not leak sensitive data (scrub tokens, passwords, etc.)
- [ ] Add request correlation IDs for tracing (optional, but recommended)

## Example Implementation Steps

### API Documentation

1. **Install Swagger module:**
   - `pnpm add @nestjs/swagger swagger-ui-express`
2. **Configure Swagger in `main.ts`:**
   - Set up SwaggerModule, document your API, and expose at `/api/docs`.
3. **Annotate controllers and DTOs:**
   - Use decorators like `@ApiTags`, `@ApiOperation`, `@ApiResponse`, `@ApiProperty`, etc.
4. **Secure docs route (optional):**
   - Only enable in development, or protect with auth.

### Logging

1. **Choose and install a logger:**
   - For Winston: `pnpm add winston @nestjs/winston`
   - For Pino: `pnpm add pino @nestjs/pino`
2. **Create a logging service:**
   - Wrap the logger, add context, and expose methods for different log levels.
3. **Replace `console.log`/`console.error` with logger calls:**
   - Use `logger.log()`, `logger.error()`, etc., throughout your app.
4. **Configure log output:**
   - Console for dev, file or external service for prod.
5. **Add request IDs/correlation IDs (optional):**
   - Use middleware/interceptor to attach a unique ID to each request and include it in logs.

## Definition of Done

The API documentation and logging setup is considered complete when:

- [ ] All required checkboxes above are checked
- [ ] API documentation is available, accurate, and up to date at `/api/docs`
- [ ] Server logs are structured, informative, and do not leak sensitive data
- [ ] Logs are accessible and useful for debugging and monitoring
- [ ] (Optional) Request correlation IDs are present in logs for tracing
